    <p>Dear Sir, </p>
    <h1><ins>RE: Response to a demand letter for payment owed to Kiarii Kimani</ins></h1>
    <p>I received a demand letter dated the 22nd November 2019 on the 25th November 2019 for a total payment of ksh
        75,000. Upon evaluation, there seems to be a few untrue accusations that I would like to address as well as
        respond to the demand letter.</p>
    <ol type="1">
       <p> <li> I, <b>Christine Murimi,</b> entered into an agreement with Kiarii Kimani (your client) on the 26th of June
            2019.
        </li></p>
        <p>The agreement was:</p>
        <ol type="a">
            <p><li>He was to shoot my wedding on the 3rd of August 2019 at ACK St Julians which he did.</li></p>
            <p><li>I was to deposit Ksh 120,000 prior to the wedding day and Ksh 60,000 was to be paid upon
                <strong>FULL</strong> delivery of keepsakes on the 17/08/19.</li></p>
            <p><li>Agreed keepsakes are:</li></p>
            <ol type="i">
               <p><li>3-5 minute Wedding trailer (delivered on 29/08/19)</li></p>
               <p> <li>1-2 hr wedding film (delivered on 14/10/19)</li></p>
               <p> <li>2 DVDs (delivered on 24/10/19)</li></p>
               <p> <li>Photobook (delivered on 3/11/19)</li></p>
                <p>*other photobook delivered on 14/10/19 was not what had been agreed upon.</p>
                <p> <li> 1200 Minimum wedding pictures</li></p>
                <p>* 669 (delivered on 4/9/19)</p>
                <p>* Remainder were to be delivered the week of 21/09/19 following our discussion on that Sunday</p>
                <p>* No maximum was set</p>
                <p>* No duplicates were to be issued</p>
            </ol>
            <p> <li>Photographs would be delivered to me in soft copy and I would provide a list of proof images from which
                your client would prepare final photographs</li></p>
            <p>*Teaser images were sent on 28/08/19</p>
            <p>*No proof images were ever sent for my selection except those of the wallmount and photobook</p>
            <li> Deadline agreed upon was 17/08/19.</li></p>
            <p>*Set deadline was never met.</p>
        </ol>
       <p><li>No extra images were requested or offered. Set minimum has not been met.</li></p> 
       <p><li> Ksh 60,000 was to be paid upon FULL delivery but your client requested 50% on the 9/09/19 which was
            facilitated.</li></p> 
        <p><b> The remainder Ksh 30,000 will only be paid upon completion of delivery.
            Delivery is not complete therefore the balance is not due.
            Payment will only be done upon complete delivery of 1300 quality images (Now that the minimum is 1200, an
            extra 100
            is not too much to ask)</b></p>
    </ol>
    <p>Upon evaluation, it is becoming clearer that your client has abandoned his commitment despite multiple asks and
        him
        making multiple guarantees that said agreement would be upheld. It is also becoming clear that this has become a
        quest for more money rather than delivery of a service.</p>
    <p> This is evidenced by the baseless figures that have currently been thrown at me.</p>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Images labelled as extra (Lot 1 and 2) delivered on the 18/10/19 and 1/11/19 respectively which I assume are
            the
            reason behind the Ksh33,000 fee were sent before your clients request for any extra fee. Conversation on
            extra
            fee
            was had on the 4/11/19 and the figure your client mentioned was 30,000.</li>
        This extra fee is irrelevant but the dates as well as the figures are inconsistent.
        <p><li>The invoice that was sent on the 4/11/19 would start attracting a 20 surchage 10 days from issuance not
            immediately. Not sure how the interest was calculated.</li></p>
       <p><li>Final images would be of high/acceptable quality. Majority of the images in lot 2 are of poor quality and
            are
            not
            acceptable.</li></p>
    </ol>
    <p><b>Take Notice: We do not appreciate being threatened, having our names tarnished both on social media platforms
            and to
            our friends as well as the constant push and pull. Services promised should be rendered without us having to
            constantly follow up.</b></p>
    <p> Any further communication will only be had once agreed services are rendered <strong>FULLY</strong></p>



    <p>Regards<br />
